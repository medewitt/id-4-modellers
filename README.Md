# Infectious Diseases for Modellers

The purpose of this book is to document information about infectious diseases with infectious disease modellers as the audience.
There are a multitude of books pointed at those from the allied sciences regarding statistics and programming, but very few going the other way.
This book seeks to fill that gap by explaining the salient topics from the allied sciences and how they align with modelling infectious disease processes and dynamics.
