As such, no effort is made to try and capture all of the entirity of the field in the resource. That being said there are exceptional resources available on may of the topics that are briefly addressed here. These include:\n\nBiology of human immune system\nHow the Immune System Works by Lauren M. Sompayrac\n\n\nMathematical modelling\nIntroduction to Infectious Disease Modeling by the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics\nThe Mathematics and Statistics of Infectious Disease Outbreaks by Tom Britton and Michael Hohle\n\n\nGenomics, phylodynamics and more\n\n\nProgramming\nReCoDE by Imperial College\nCEIRR Computational Modeling Core"
