The field of infectious diseases is highly multidisciplinary as many applied fields tend to be.
Studying infectious diseases involves to varying degrees different understanding ecology, molecular biology, human behaviour, immunology, virology, bacteriology, mycology, population biology, and a wide array of mathematics (from stochastic branching processes, ordinary differential equations, time series analysis, spatial approaches).
As applied fields go, working infectious diseases means you will likely be on a team of experiements.
Quantative approaches towards infectious diseases then means that a basic understanding of a variety of these fields is helpful for teasing out the insights that can be captured through modelling, what details while important can be left out, and participate in conversations.
