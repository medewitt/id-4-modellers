# Laboratory Methods {#lab}

Surveillance, detection, and diagnosis often rely on laboratory tests or assays.
Understanding how these assays function is essential for building good models for disease transmission.
Each approach has its own requirements and characteristics that may play into the way an infectious disease modeller needs to treat these data.
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolution of the cycle time of real-time PCR tests became a popular way of assessing the viral dynamics within a person and more general to the population.
These kinds of insights would be impossible without knowing the properties of the assays.
